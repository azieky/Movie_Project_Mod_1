## Abstract:
Using Return on Investment as a metric for the engagement and expansion of audience per dollar spent, our project considers what seasons, genres, and plots could be used to launch a new streaming service.

## Data Collection 
To collect data we started with the data that was given to use in the zippeddata file. The bulk of our data was scraped from the IMDB website. The first web scraper was used to pull IMDB keys for each of the films in our dataset by using the IMDB search function. The second utilized the IMDB keys to gather basic film information not in the numbers database like genre, runtime, MPAA rating, and cast. The third webscaper was used to collect plot keywords from a second IMDB url. We queried using the IMDB ID in a url and to loop through each movie page retrieving a list of the top 10 plot keywords. 
 
## Data Cleaning
The primary focus of our initial data cleaning was to correctly render integers and floats numerically, so that we could perform initial queries. 
After our scrapes of IMDB, we focused on rendering the data we collected as iterable lists that could be juxtaposed in tandem to the domestic and world return on investment information generated by The Numbers data, so that we could produce more specialized visualizations. 
## Data Visualization
We used both matplotlib and seaborn to effectively visualize our data. 
 
# Introduction

Critics and audiences can often stand at opposite ends when it comes to what makes a great movie. Only, audiences don’t just vote with their voices but also with their ticket purchases. Added to this question of what makes a great movie is the current landscape and strategies of streaming services. In the hypothetical scenario of MIcrosoft launching their own streaming service, we’ve developed a strategy for the platform by analyzing 1,780 movies released during the 2010s from data scraped from The Numbers and IMDB

To figure out how Microsoft’s platform could succeed, we began by asking the following questions:
    When are audiences most likely to engage with a new film? 
    What genres have the highest return on investment?
    What plots have the highest return on investment?

### Why use return on investment to measure audience engagement?

Since only when a film recuperates twice its budget is it considered financially successful, when a film triples, quadruples, or quintuples it can be considered exemplary. The news is dominated by big budget movies breaking box office records, but cases where a film makes several times more than what was initially invested would be more rewarding models for a new streaming platform.
As Microsoft’s new streaming service would want to expand its audience as quickly as possible, using the release and content of films with high domestic and world return on investment as a template would focus the platform’s initial strategy on the kinds of stories and content that would quickly expand its audience beyond its initial budget, as opposed to those films that are critically praised but popularly derided and those films with behemoth budgets.

### When are audiences most likely to engage with a new film?
One of the first questions that comes to mind is when is the best time to release our movie? It is no surprise that major studio marketing teams put a lot of strategy into deciding when is the optimal time for a movie to be released. We looked at four major visualizations to help paint a clear picture for us. The first two look at total gross for domestic and worldwide releases.  

![Domestic Gross by Month](https://github.com/azieky/Movie_Project_Mod_1/blob/Alex/Data_Visualizations/dom_gross_month.png)
![Worldwide Gross by Month](https://github.com/azieky/Movie_Project_Mod_1/blob/Alex/Data_Visualizations/world_gross_month.png)

Going off these bar graphs, it looks like the best time for a movie to make the most money would be during the late spring, and summer months. The next visualizations show the return on investment by month.

![Mean Worldwide Return on Investment](https://github.com/azieky/Movie_Project_Mod_1/blob/Alex/Data_Visualizations/world_roi_month.png)

These graphs paint a less clear picture. Still the summer months seems to be a good time to invest in releasing a movie. It seems there is no “safe” bet when deciding when to release a movie. But hopefully these data insights can at least help point us in the right directions. 

### What genres have the highest return on investment?

When we began our intialing cleaning and exploratory data analysis of The Number, we assumed that the films causing the spike in return on investment in July and throughout the dataset were superhero films and big budget science fiction movies. However, we were surprised to find that these movies were most often horror films, with the found footage film The Gallows (2015) leading the pack with a domestic return on investment of 227 times its budget of $100,000 and world return on investment of 441. While this movie’s astronomical return on investment did skew averages, its still evident from below that the top ROI earners from the past decade are primarily horror films.

Teenagers are often assumed to be the ones supporting movie theaters the most, so perhaps catering to their tastes in horror movies would be an excellent strategy for Microsoft’s nascent platform.

To study this situation further, we compared the average budget by genre to the average return on investment, finding that though Adventure films like the Marvel and D.C. movies have the highest average budget, this genre of film lags behind several other genres.

![Comparing Budget to Return on Investment by Genre](https://github.com/azieky/Movie_Project_Mod_1/blob/Alex/Data_Visualizations/comp_bud_roi_genre.png)

To answer why Adventure films are so omnipresent, we did a detailed comparison of the distribution of return on investment for the genre compared to that of horror films to learn why 
one might invest in one 100 million dollar film when they could invest in five 20 million dollar films.

![Return on Investment Distribution for Adventure vs Horror Movies](https://github.com/azieky/Movie_Project_Mod_1/blob/Alex/Data_Visualizations/ROI_adv_vs_hor.png)

Though many adventure films failed to break even domestically, several would at least made up their budgets and then made money when released internationally. The fate of horror films were far less certain. With a large spread of return on investment per film, those that failed to recuperate their budget domestically do not seem as likely to recuperate it abroad.

Arguably the risk/reward of the adventure/superhero genres make sense for large film studios. Unlike horror films these films are profitable beyond the box office, judging by product tie-ins and merchandising. These studio Adventure films are a secure and safe investment for their large budgets.

However, because streaming platforms operate on subscription models with single investors, you would want to work in genres that on average would expand audiences. 25 episodes of Stranger Things with a 6 million dollar budget per episode is less than third of the budget of Avengers: Endgame. One would draw audiences to a box office and perhaps to a nascent streaming platform for a year while the other could draw for five. So our second suggestion to Microsoft is to create original Horror, Mystery, Thriller, and Sci-Fi content, as these genres are shown to have a larger pull per dollar spent.

### What plots have the highest return on investment?
We wanted to specify our analysis beyond genre to include what types of stories audiences were interested in, so we executed a scrape of plot keywords, which are user-assigned and ordered by user votes and algorithmically derived relevance. For example, though it has no votes, the first plot keyword for Father of the Bride Part II is fatherhood. 

The scrape involved pulling the top ten keywords. The top three most frequent plot keywords of the past decade as tagged by users were female nudity, sequel, and sex scene. However, the latter was tied with movies featuring a female protagonist. 

![Most Frequent Plot Elements in Sample](https://github.com/azieky/Movie_Project_Mod_1/blob/Alex/Data_Visualizations/freq_plot_ele.png)

![Plot Term Comparison Based on Distribution of Return on Investment](https://github.com/azieky/Movie_Project_Mod_1/blob/Alex/Data_Visualizations/plot_term_comp.png)

Though more movies in our sample featured female nudity than a female protagonist, the distribution of return on investment showed that movies featuring a female lead were more successful with audiences. We would add to our suggestions having female protagonists in Microsoft’s original programming.

To provide further suggestions on how this data could help craft content for this platform, we took a representative slice of top earning plot elements, which though not the most frequent, appeared in more than a half percentage point of the sample set. These keywords can pertain to a movie’s topics, overarching themes, settings, plot devices, and characters. Not only were these plot elements popular with studios, they were popular with audiences as well.

As many financially successful films explored these keywords as identified and labeled by their audiences, it could be worthwhile using such keywords as launching off points for new content, either in combination or on each term’s own.

For example:
There’s this high school that had a recent suicide because of a kidnapped singer, and now it’s haunted by a ghost with supernatural powers. It’s full of suspense and dysfunctional family.

## CONCLUSION

By analyzing The Numbers dataset to create domestic and worldwide return on investment for each film and scraping IMDB’s website to expand this initial analysis, we provided several business suggestions for launching a new streaming platform. As part of our scrapes of IMDB, we also gathered cast, writer, director, audience scores, and metacritic scores. We had initially hoped to utilize the index positions of top-billing order cast lists in order to find actors and actresses who had supporting roles in films with high return on investment as a possible way to lay the foundations to automate cast and crew recommendations for Microsoft’s platform. Due to time constraints we also had to scrap plans to index and weigh plot keywords according to a similar strategy. We acknowledge the lack of critic and audience scores as an omission that could have strengthen our project. However, it’s worth noting that according to our data most of the twenty movies with the highest return on investment were heavily derided by both audiences and critics.
